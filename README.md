# TravelGram

TravelGram is a social media web appliation designed to bring together communities of travelers. It is built using React.js and uses mock data curated by me from the local server.

Upon loading the application, the user is first directed to their feed, where they can hover over each image in order to view its location and current likes.
On the right, the user is prompted to follow fellow travelers.

Using the navigation bar at the top of the screen, a user can switch tabs to browse the Explore section, or view thier own Profile.

TravelGram's explore section can be sorted by location, or by similarity to the user's previously favorited posts. In addition to their own feed, a user can 
view their favorited posts as well as the travelers they are currently following.
